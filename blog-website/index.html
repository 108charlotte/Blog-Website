      <p id="bio">I'm a rising high school junior who enjoys programming and running in my free time. Right now, I want to expand my coding skills, build a portfolio, and learn more about the theory behind AI and its applications in the workforce. Right now, I am participating in the Girls Who Code Pathways self-paced learning program and participating in an internship to learn more about AI's usages in healthcare! This blog is just a way for me to document my thoughts and experiences, and share them with the world!</p>
