      <p>JARVIS is a python-powered audio-based chatbot which receives user input through the browser, sends it to a Flask backend to be processed, and then returns the response to the user using text-to-speech. This project is still very buggy, but you can view the demo at this <a href="https://jarvis-python-voice-assistant.onrender.com/">render link</a> (please note that it may take some time to boot)!</p>

        <p>After taking a plethora of online courses in an attempt to self-teach programming, from codecademy to CS50, I can now conclude that <strong>no matter how many courses you complete,</strong> you will <em>never</em> learn how to code without completing <em><strong>real projects</strong></em></p>
